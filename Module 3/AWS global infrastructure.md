**Selecting a Region**

When determining the right Region for your services, data, and applications, consider the following four business factors. 

* **Compliance with data governance and legal requirements**

Depending on your company and location, you might need to run your data out of specific areas. For example, if your company requires all of its data to reside within the boundaries of the UK, you would choose the London Region. 

Not all companies have location-specific data regulations, so you might need to focus more on the other three factors.

* **Proximity to your customers**

Selecting a Region that is close to your customers will help you to get content to them faster. For example, your company is based in Washington, DC, and many of your customers live in Singapore. You might consider running your infrastructure in the Northern Virginia Region to be close to company headquarters, and run your applications from the Singapore Region.
