**Selecting a Region**

When determining the right Region for your services, data, and applications, consider the following four business factors. 

* **Compliance with data governance and legal requirements**

Depending on your company and location, you might need to run your data out of specific areas. For example, if your company requires all of its data to reside within the boundaries of the UK, you would choose the London Region. 

Not all companies have location-specific data regulations, so you might need to focus more on the other three factors.
