 # Amazon EC2 instance types
 
 Amazon EC2 instance types are optimized for different tasks. When selecting an instance type, consider the specific needs of your workloads and applications.
 This might include requirements for compute, memory, or storage capabilities.

**General purpose instances**
General purpose instances provide a balance of compute, memory, and networking resources. You can use them for a variety of workloads, such as:

* application servers
* gaming servers
* backend servers for enterprise applications
* small and medium databases

Suppose that you have an application in which the resource needs for compute, memory, and networking are roughly equivalent. You might consider running it on a general purpose instance because the application does not require optimization in any single resource area.
