# Deployment models for cloud computing
When selecting a cloud strategy, a company must consider factors such as required cloud application components, preferred resource management tools, 
and any legacy IT infrastructure requirements.

The three cloud computing deployment models are cloud-based, on-premises, and hybrid. 

**cloud-based deployment**
* Run all parts of the application in the cloud.
* Migrate existing applications to the cloud.
* Design and build new applications in the cloud.

In a cloud-based deployment model, you can migrate existing applications to the cloud, or you can design and build new applications in the cloud. You can build those applications on low-level infrastructure that requires your IT staff to manage them. Alternatively, you can build them using higher-level services that reduce the management, architecting, and scaling requirements of the core infrastructure.

For example, a company might create an application consisting of virtual servers, databases, and networking components that are fully based in the cloud.
