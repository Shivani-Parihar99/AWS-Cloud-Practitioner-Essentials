# Deployment models for cloud computing
When selecting a cloud strategy, a company must consider factors such as required cloud application components, preferred resource management tools, 
and any legacy IT infrastructure requirements.

The three cloud computing deployment models are cloud-based, on-premises, and hybrid. 

**cloud-based deployment**
* Run all parts of the application in the cloud.
* Migrate existing applications to the cloud.
* Design and build new applications in the cloud.

In a cloud-based deployment model, you can migrate existing applications to the cloud, or you can design and build new applications in the cloud. You can build those applications on low-level infrastructure that requires your IT staff to manage them. Alternatively, you can build them using higher-level services that reduce the management, architecting, and scaling requirements of the core infrastructure.

For example, a company might create an application consisting of virtual servers, databases, and networking components that are fully based in the cloud.

**on-premises deployment**
* Deploy resources by using virtualization and resource management tools.
* Increase resource utilization by using application management and virtualization technologies.

On-premises deployment is also known as a private cloud deployment. In this model, resources are deployed on premises by using virtualization and resource management tools.

For example, you might have applications that run on technology that is fully kept in your on-premises data center. Though this model is much like legacy IT infrastructure, its incorporation of application management and virtualization technologies helps to increase resource utilization.
